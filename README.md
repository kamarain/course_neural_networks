# Material for Short Course about Neural Network Machine Learning (course_neural_networks)
This repo contains material to teach neural networks starting from the basics. The following topics are covered (aiming for two hour lecture each):

 1. Single neuron model and the fundamentals from 1940's
 2. Feedforward neural network from 1980's
 3. Convolutional neural networks from 2010's
 4. Special architectures from 2020's

Every topic is covered during an interactive 2h session in Finnish or English and is tailored for the audience. For every topic this repo contains:

 * Handwritten notes
 * A Jupyter notebook of code examples during the interactive sessions
